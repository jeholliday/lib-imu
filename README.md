# lib-imu

This is a class driver for obtaining sensor data from the IMU Digital Combo Board from SparkFun (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10121). This IMU includes an accelerometer (the ADXL345) and a gyroscope (the ITG3200). 

All code written here was adapted from Arduino code written by Varesano (http://www.varesano.net/).
